// TODO: It's inefficient to hash a request every time it is needed to get the request ID

// This function is used by the messenger as the handler function for requests (the main file performs the assignment).
// Simply adds the received request to the corresponding request buffer.
// TODO: If too many threads (64 or more in the current deployment with 32-core machines) invoke Add(),
//
//	the buffer locks get extremely contended.
//	Have only a fixed (configurable) number of threads invoking Add().
//	Spawn those worker threads in the Init() function and make HandleRequest (this function) only write
//	the request to a channel (do we need a big channel buffer for this?) that a worker reads.
//	It would make sense to send requests from the same client to the same worker,
//	Since the Buffer lock to be acquired by the worker is determined by the clientID.
//	The lock being acquired by the same thread is crucial for avoiding contention.
//	If this is not enough, try having the worker threads add requests to buffers in batches.
//	(Although this might be very tricky if we want to avoid verifying signatures while holding the buffer lock,
//	and at the same time avoid verifying the signature again, in case the request is already present.)
